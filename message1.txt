Dear all xob programmers

we recently have decided to begin our first group effort. We all have our specialties,
wether it be social engineering, programming, or engineering we must unite as one.
Us programmers have the task of creating keyloggers and worms in whatever language you are
most familiar with.
engineers your task is to create tools for network pen testing
social engineers will be collaborating with the programmers and will await further instructions
remember stay frosty
