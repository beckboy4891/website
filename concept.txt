Dear all xob members,

Happy holidays this year our gift to you is a nice little program that you will love to debug.
The following concept and code (python) is written in .txt format. The cause of this is because of
the computer I (XOB) am using to write it. This program is a small little game. It is based around the
real computer game Counter Strike Global Offensive. In csgo we all know that you can open cases to get
skins. But for those of us who don't want to feed into these money eating bugs, we have created a simple
cost free program that allows us to open our little cases without dealing with the repercussions.
This also will teach those of you who are not fluent in python, how the lanuage works. This was of course
created by the member Python Master, as a start to a long list of programs we will be making, and explaining
to increase your understanding of this powerful coding language. 
Happy Holidays to All, Xob and Python master......

The probability of lists of guns below
RARE KNIVES 5% 1-5
RARE GUNS 5%   6-11
NORMAL GUNS 50% 12-62
RED SKINS 10 % 62-72
PURPLE 30% 73-100

Concept:
The program will generate a random number then compare that number to a set of
lists with corrosponding numbers the list with a matching number then gets a
random skin chosen from that list. The skin has a value and the player can
either sell the skin back to the game and try again or keep the skin. When the 
player chooses to keep the skin the case amount is subtracted from the total
money, and the skin that is kept is then added to a new list of skins called 
inventory, the player can stop opening the cases at any time or until he/she 
runs out of money. After the player runs out of money the amount earned is then
compared to the original starting amount and profit margine is calculated. The
player wins by making profit, and loses by not making profit.
SAMPLE CODE:

t = Terminal()

case = 2.5
start = ("Welcome to the csgo case game")
print t.green start

print ("You start with 125$ in your paypal, each case costs 2.5$")
print ("Each time you open a case your account decreases by the amount,")
print ("the case costs. After you open the case you will have the choice to")
print ("either keep the skin it gives you and add it to your profit pool,or sell the skin")
print ("back to the game adding that amount to your total paypal amount. When you")
print ("are out of money the game will decide if you've made profit or lost money")
print ("Now that you understand how it works lets get started!")
